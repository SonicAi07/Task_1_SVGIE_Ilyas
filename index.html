                    <h3>₹ 3.29 Crores</h3>
                </div>
                <p>The Aston Martin DB11 is more of a Grand Tourer (GT) than an outright supercar. Sold in a 5.2-litre
                    twin-turbo V12 or 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 avatar, the Aston Martin DB11 showcases exceptional
                    British
                    engineering and craftsmanship. The car is available with a host of unique customisation choices for
                    both
                    the exterior and interior. The Aston Martin DB series is also famous for its role in James Bond
                    movies.

                <h2>2. MERCEDES BENZ AMG GT</h2>

                    <img src="./images/car-2.jpg" alt="image3">
                    <h3>₹ 2.64 Crores</h3>
                </div>
                <p>The Mercedes-AMG GT is currently sold in three variants: GT, GT S and the GT R. While the AMG GT and
                    the
                    GT S are good performers, it is the AMG GT R that has set records. Dubbed as the ‘Beast of the Green
                    Hell’, the Mercedes-AMG GT R showcases outright performance and was the fastest car around the
                    Nurburgring racetrack when it was launched. The AMG GT R also makes a really good exhaust note from
                    its
                    4.0-litre biturbo V8 engine
                </p>

                <h2>3. FERRARI 812</h2>

                    <h3>₹ 3.29 Crores</h3>
                </div>
                <p>The Ferrari 812 Superfast is the current flagship ‘mass-production’ V12-engined model from the brand.
                    Replacement to the F12 Berlinetta, the Ferrari 812 Superfast is a front-engined car in contrast to
                    the
                    brand’s conventional mid-engine layout. The 812 Superfast is also an important model for Ferrari and
                    car
                    enthusiasts since it is could be one of the last naturally-aspirated V12 supercars ever to be made.

                <h2>4. NISSAN GT-R</h2>
                <div class="car_price">
                    <img src="./images/car-4.jpg" alt="image6">
                    <h3>₹ 3.29 Crores</h3>
                </div>
                <p>The Nissan GT-R aka Godzilla is one of the most popular supercar names in the world. The current R35
                    GT-R
                    is kind of a bargain buy compared to a Ferrari or a Lamborghini. Known as the ‘supercar killer’, the
                    Nissan GT-R showcases enough performance to challenge supercars double its price, on a racetrack.
                    The
                    3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V6, the all-wheel-drive system and the decades-old heritage have won the
                    GT-R millions of fans over the years.
